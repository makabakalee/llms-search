Paper Search

# Abstract

We introduce PaSa, an advanced Paper Search agent powered by large language models. PaSa can autonomously make a series of decisions, including invoking search tools, reading papers, and selecting relevant references, to ultimately obtain comprehensive and accurate results for complex scholar queries. We optimize PaSa using reinforcement learning with a synthetic dataset, AutoScholarQuery, which includes 35k fine- grained academic queries and corresponding papers sourced from top- tier AI conference publications. Additionally, we develop RealScholarQuery, a benchmark collecting real- world academic queries to assess PaSa performance in more realistic scenarios. Despite being trained on synthetic data, PaSa significantly outperforms existing baselines on RealScholarQuery, including Google, Google Scholar, Google with GPT- 4o for paraphrased queries, ChatGPT (search- enabled GPT- 4o), GPT- o1, and PaSa- GPT- 4o (PaSa implemented by prompting GPT- 4o).Notably, PaSa- 7B surpasses the best Google- based baseline, Google with GPT- 4o, by  $37.78\%$  in recall  $< 20$  and  $39.90\%$  in recall  $< 50$  , and exceeds PaSa- GPT4o by  $30.36\%$  in recall and  $4.25\%$  in precision. Model, datasets, and code are available at https://github.com/bytedance/pasa.

# 1 Introduction

Academic paper search lies at the core of research yet represents a particularly challenging informa tion retrieval task. It requires long- tail specialized knowledge, comprehensive survey- level coverage, and the ability to address fine- grained queries. For instance, consider the query: "Which studies have focused on non- stationary reinforcement learning using value- based methods, specifically UCB- based algorithms?" While widely used academic search systems like Google Scholar are effective for general queries, they often fall short when addressing these complex queries (Gusenbauer and Haddaway, 2020). Consequently, researchers frequently spend substantial time conducting literature surveys (Kingsley et al., 2011; Gusenbauer and Haddaway, 2021).

The advancements in large language models (LLMs) (OpenAI, 2023; Anthropic, 2024; Gemini, 2023; Yang et al., 2024) have inspired numerous studies leveraging LLMs to enhance information retrieval, particularly by refining or reformulating search queries to improve retrieval quality (Alaofi et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023; Ma et al., 2023; Peng et al., 2024). In academic search, however, the process goes beyond simple retrieval. Human researchers not only use search tools, but also engage in deeper activities, such as reading relevant papers and checking citations, to perform comprehensive and accurate literature surveys.

In this paper, we introduce PaSa, a novel paper search agent designed to mimic human behavior for comprehensive and accurate academic paper searches. As illustrated in Figure 1, PaSa consists of two LLM agents: the Crawler and the Se

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-08-07/859ce14e-f415-41a6-b1af-36ef3349169e/ac556bf4d486a22310bed36573dc99ff8c8e8d7357fda11cb651b54890e5203d.jpg)  
Figure 1: Architecture of PaSa. The system consists of two LLM agents, Crawler and Selector. The Crawler processes the user query and can access papers from the paper queue. It can autonomously invoke the search tool, expand citations, or stop processing of the current paper. All papers collected by the Crawler are appended to the paper queue. The Selector reads each paper in the paper queue to determine whether it meets the criteria specified in the user query.

lector. For a given user query, the Crawler can autonomously collect relevant papers by utilizing search tools or extracting citations from the current paper, which are then added to a growing paper queue. The Crawler iteratively processes each paper in the paper queue, navigating citation networks to discover increasingly relevant papers. The Selector carefully reads each paper in the paper queue to determine whether it meets the requirements of the user query. We optimize PaSa within the AGILE, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for LLM agents (Feng et al., 2024).

Effective training requires high- quality academic search data. Fortunately, human scientists have already created a vast amount of high- quality academic papers, which contain extensive surveys on a wide range of research topics. We build a synthetic but high- quality academic search dataset, AutoScholarQuery, which collects fine- grained scholar queries and their corresponding relevant papers from the related work sections of papers published at ICLR 2023<sup>1</sup>, ICML 2023<sup>2</sup>, NeurIPS 2023<sup>3</sup>, ACL 2024<sup>4</sup>, and CVPR 2024<sup>5</sup>. AutoScholarQuery includes 33,511 / 1,000 / 1,000 query- paper pairs in the training / development / test split.

Although AutoScholarQuery only provides query and paper answers, without demonstrating the path by which scientists collect the papers, we can utilize it to perform RL training to improve PaSa. In addition, we design a new session- level

PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization (Schulman et al., 2017)) training method to address the unique challenges of the paper search task: 1) sparse reward: The papers in AutoScholarQuery are collected via citations, making it a smaller subset of the actual qualified paper set. 2) long trajectories: The complete trajectory of the Crawler may involve hundreds of papers, which is too long to directly input into the LLM context.

To evaluate PaSa, besides the test set of AutoScholarQuery, we also develop a benchmark, RealScholarQuery. It contains 50 real- world academic queries with annotated relevant papers, to assess PaSa in real- world scenarios. We compare PaSa with several baselines including Google, Google Scholar, Google paired with GPT- 4o for paraphrased queries, ChatGPT (search- enabled GPT4o), GPT- o1 and PaSa- GPT- 4o (PaSa agent realized by prompting GPT- 4o). Our experiments show that PaSa- 7b significantly outperforms all baselines. Specifically, for AutoScholarQuery test set, PaSa7b achieves a  $34.05\%$  improvement in Recall  $< 20$  and a  $39.36\%$  improvement in Recall  $< 50$  compared to Google with GPT- 4o, the strongest Google- based baseline. PaSa- 7b surpasses PaSa- GPT- 4o by  $11.12\%$  in recall, with similar precision. For RealScholarQuery, PaSa- 7b outperforms Google with GPT- 4o by  $37.78\%$  in Recall  $< 20$  and  $39.90\%$  in Recall  $< 50$ . PaSa- 7b surpasses PaSa- GPT- 4o by  $30.36\%$  in recall and  $4.25\%$  in precision.

The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:

- We introduce PaSa, a comprehensive and accurate paper search agent that can autonomously use online search tools, read entire papers, and navigate citation networks.

- We develop two high-quality datasets for complex academic search, AutoScholarQuery and RealScholarQuery.- Although PaSa is trained solely on synthetic data, it achieves remarkable real-world performance. Experiments demonstrate that PaSa, built on 7B LLM, significantly outperforms all baselines, including GPT-4 agent, Google-based search, and ChatGPT.

# 2 Related Work

LLMs in Scientific Discovery LLMs have been applied across various stages of scientific discovery (Van Noorden and Perkel, 2023; Lu et al., 2024; Messeri and Crockett, 2024; Liao et al., 2024), such as brainstorming ideas (Giroitra et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024a; Baek et al., 2024), designing experiments (M. Bran et al., 2024), writing code (Xu et al., 2022), and generating research papers (Shao et al., 2024; Agarwal et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024b). One of the most fundamental yet critical stages in research is conducting academic surveys. Despite its importance, current tools like Google Scholar are often insufficient, leading researchers to spend considerable time on literature review tasks (Kingsley et al., 2011; Gusenbauer and Haddaway, 2021, 2020). This challenge motivates us to develop PaSa, an LLM agent designed to autonomously and comprehensively assist researchers in collecting relevant research papers for complex scholarly queries.

LLM Agents LLM Agents combine LLMs with memory, tool use, and planning, enabling them to perform more complex tasks such as personal copilots (Stratton, 2024), travel planning (Gundawar et al., 2024), web operations (Deng et al., 2024), software development (Qian et al., 2023), and scientific experimentation (Bran et al., 2023). In addition to realizing LLM Agents through prompt engineering (Park et al., 2023; Yao et al., 2023; Shinn et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2023), recent research has focused on optimizing and training these agents (Feng et al., 2024; Putta et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023). Among these efforts, AGILE (Feng et al., 2024), a reinforcement learning framework for LLM agents, allows the joint optimization of all agent skills in an end- to- end manner. In our work, we adopt the AGILE framework to implement PaSa. Specifically, we design a novel session- level PPO algorithm to address the unique challenges of the paper search task, including sparse rewards and long trajectories.

# 3 Datasets

# 3.1 AutoScholarQuery

AutoScholarQuery is a synthetic but high- quality dataset of academic queries and related papers, specifically curated for the AI field.

To construct AutoScholarQuery, we began by collecting all papers published at ICLR 2023, ICML 2023, NeurIPS 2023, ACL 2024, and CVPR 2024. For the Related Work section of each paper, we prompted GPT- 4b (Hurst et al., 2024) to generate scholarly queries, where the answers to these queries correspond to the references cited in the Related Work section. The prompt used is shown in Appendix H.1. For each query, we retained only the papers that could be retrieved on arXiv<sup>6</sup>, using their arxiv_id as the unique article identifier in the dataset. We adopt the publication date of the source paper as the query date. During both training and testing, we only considered papers published prior to the query date.

The final AutoScholarQuery dataset comprises 33,551, 1,000, and 1,000 instances in the training, development, and testing splits, respectively. Each instance consists of a query, the associated paper set, and the query date, with queries in each split derived from distinct source papers. Table 1 provides illustrative examples from AutoScholarQuery, while additional dataset statistics are summarized in Table 2.

To evaluate the quality of AutoScholarQuery, we sampled 100 query- paper pairs and assessed the rationality and relevance of each query and the corresponding paper. A qualified query should be meaningful and unambiguous. A qualified paper should match the requirements of the scholarly query. Detailed evaluation criteria are provided in Appendix. A. Three authors manually reviewed each pair, determining that  $94.0\%$  of the queries were qualified. Among these qualified queries,  $93.7\%$  had corresponding papers that were deemed relevant and appropriate.

# 3.2 RealScholarQuery

To evaluate PaSa in more realistic scenarios, we constructed RealScholarQuery, a test dataset consisting of 50 real- world research queries. After launching the demo of PaSa, we invited several AI

researchers to use the system. From the queries they provided, we randomly sampled a subset of queries and manually filtered out overly broad topics (e.g., "multimodal large language models," "video generation"). Ultimately, we collected 50 fine- grained and realistic queries.

For each query, we first manually gathered relevant papers to the best of our ability. To ensure comprehensive coverage, we then applied multiple methods to retrieve additional papers, including PaSa, Google, Google Scholar, ChatGPT (search- enabled GPT- 4o), and Google paired with GPT- 4o for paraphrased queries. As these methods also serve as baselines for comparison with PaSa, implementation details are deferred to Section 5.2. The results from all methods were aggregated into a pool of candidate papers. Finally, professional annotators reviewed all candidate papers for each query, selecting those that met the specific require ments of the query to create the final set of relevant papers. Annotation guidelines and quality control procedures are detailed in Appendix. B. The query date of all instances in RealScholarQuery is 2024- 10- 01. Table 9 in Appendix C provides an example from RealScholarQuery.

The annotators included professors from the Department of Computer Science at a top- tier university in China. On average, each query required the annotators to review 76 candidate papers. We paid  $4 per data entry (a query - paper pair), resulting in an average of$ 304 per query. Given the high annotation cost, we completed this process for only 50 instances. On average, each query is associated with 15.82 answer papers. The 50th percentile of answer counts per query is 9, while the 90th percentile reaches 37.

# 4 Methodology

# 4.1 Overview

As illustrated in Figure 1, the PaSa system consists of two LLM agents: Crawler and Selector. The crawler reads the user's query, generates multiple search queries, and retrieves relevant papers. The retrieved papers are added to a paper queue. The Crawler further processes each paper in the paper queue to identify key citations worth exploring further, appending any newly relevant papers to the paper queue. The selector conducts a thorough review of each paper in the paper queue to assess whether it fulfills the user's query requirements.

Figure 2: An example of the PaSa workflow. The Crawler runs multiple [Search] using diverse and complementary queries. In addition, the Crawler can evaluate the long-term value of its actions. Notably, it discovers many relevant papers as it explores deeper in the citation network, even when intermediate papers along the path do not align with the user query.

In summary, the Crawler is designed to maximize the recall of relevant papers, whereas the Se- . lector emphasizes precision in identifying papers that meet the user's needs.

# 4.2Crawler

In RL terminology, the Crawler performs a tokenlevel Markov Decision Process (MDP). The action space  $\mathcal{A}$  corresponds to the LLM's vocabulary, where each token represents an action. The LLM functions as the policy model. The agent's state is defined by the current LLM context and the paper queue. The Crawler operates with three registered functions, as outlined in Table 3. When an action matches a function name, the corresponding function is executed, further modifying the agent's state.

For example, as Figure 2 shows, the agent begins by receiving a user query, incorporating it into its context, and initiating actions. If the token generated is [Search], the LLM continues to generate a search query, and the agent invokes a search tool to retrieve papers, which are then added to the paper queue. If the token is [Expand], the LLM continues to extract a subsection name from the current paper in its context. The agent then extracts all referenced papers within that subsection, adding them to the paper queue. If the token is [Stop], the agent resets its context to the user query and information of the next paper in the paper queue. This information includes the title, abstract, and an outline of all sections and subsections.

The training process for the Crawler comprises two stages. In the first stage, we generate trajectories for a small subset of the training data and then perform imitation learning (see Appendix D.1 for details). In the second stage, reinforcement learning is applied. The details of the RL training implementation are described below.

Reward Design We conduct RL training on the AutoScholarQuery training set, where each instance consists of a query  $q$  and a corresponding paper set  $\mathcal{P}$  . Starting with a query  $q$  , the Crawler generates a trajectory  $\tau = (s_{1},a_{1},\dots ,s_{T},a_{T})$  .At each time step  $t$  , we denote the current paper queue as  $\mathcal{Q}_t$  . Upon taking action  $a_{t}$  , the Crawler appends a set of new papers  $(p_{1},p_{2},\dots ,p_{n_{t}})$  to the paper queue. If  $a_{t} = [\mathrm{Stop}]$  , the set is empty and no papers are added.

The reward of executing action  $a_{t}$  in state  $s_t$  is defined as

$$
r(s_t,a_t) = \alpha \times \sum_{i = 1}^{n_t}\mathbb{I}(q,p_i,t) - c(a_t), \tag{1}
$$

where  $\mathbb{I}(q,p_i,t) = 1$  if  $p_i$  matches the query  $q$  and is not already in  $\mathcal{Q}_t$  ,and  $\mathbb{I}(q,p_i,t) = 0$  otherwise. Here,  $\alpha$  is a reward coefficient, and  $c(a_{t})$  is the cost of action  $a_{t}$

The indicator function  $\mathbb{I}(q,p_i,t)$  can be determined by checking if  $p_i$  belongs to  $\mathcal{P} - \mathcal{Q}_t$  .However, it is important to note that the AutoScholarQuery may only include a subset of the groundtruth papers, as citations often emphasize a limited number of key references. If the Crawler receives rewards solely based on matching papers in AutoScholarQuery, this could lead to sparse rewards during training. To mitigate this, we use the Selector as an auxiliary reward model for the Crawler. The revised definition of  $\mathbb{I}(q,p_i,t)$  is:

$$
\mathbb{I}(q,p_i,t) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}1, & \mathrm{if~(Selector}(q,p_i) = 1\mathrm{~or~}p_i\in \mathcal{P})\\ \qquad \mathrm{and~}p_i\notin \mathcal{Q}_t,\\ 0, & \mathrm{otherwise.} \end{array} \right. \tag{2}
$$

Here Selector  $(q,p_i) = 1$  if paper  $p_i$  is identified as correct to meet the query  $q$  by the Selector, and Selector  $(q,p_i) = 0$  otherwise.

RL Training A key challenge in training the Crawler with RL is the significant time required to sample a complete trajectory for a given query. This is due to each [Search] or [Expand] action adding multiple papers to the paper queue, resulting in hundreds or even thousands of papers in the final paper queue.

To address this issue, we define a session as a sub- trajectory that ends with the [Stop] action, after which a new session begins. We identify two types of initial states for such sub- trajectories:  $S_{q}$  containing only the user query, and  $S_{q + p}$  , containing both the query and a paper.  $S_{q}$  represents the task's starting point, where the LLM context includes only the query. In contrast,  $S_{q + p}$  arises after a [Stop] action, where the LLM context is reset to the query and the next paper in the queue.

Formally, we model the Crawler as a policy  $\pi_{\theta}(a_t|s_t)$  .We partition the entire trajectory  $\tau = (s_{1},a_{1},\dots ,s_{T},a_{T})$  into a sequence of sessions:  $(\tau_{t_1:t_2 - 1},\tau_{t_2:t_2 - 1},\dots)$  .Each session is  $\tau_{t_i:t_{i + 1} - 1} = (s_{t_i},a_{t_i},\dots ,s_{t_{i + 1} - 1},a_{t_{i + 1} - 1})$  where the initial state  $s_{t_i}$  is either belonging to type  $S_{q}$  or  $S_{q + p}$  , and the final action  $a_{t_{i + 1} - 1}$  is [STOP].

Sampling such a sub- trajectory from these session initial states is computationally efficient. During the PPO training, at time step  $t\in [t_i,t_{i + 1})$  we estimate the return in the session using Monte Carlo sampling:

$$
\begin{array}{rcl}\hat{R}_t & = & \sum_{k = t}^{t_{i + 1} - 1}\gamma_0^{k - 1t}\Big[r(s_k,a_k)\\ & & +\gamma_1\sum_{j = 1}^{n_k}\hat{V}_\phi (S_{q + p_j})\Big] - \beta \cdot \log \frac{\pi_\theta(a_t|s_t)}{\pi_{\mathrm{soft}}(a_t|s_t)} \end{array} \tag{3}
$$

Here,  $\gamma_0$  is the in- session discount factor, and  $\gamma_{1}$  is the across- session discount factor.  $\hat{V}_{\phi}(\cdot)$  is the value function model to approximate the state value. After executing  $a_{k}$  , the paper queue is updated to include the newly found papers  $(p_{1},p_{2},\dots ,p_{n_{k}})$  Since the Crawler will subsequently initiate new sessions to process these additional papers, their associated reward- to- go should be incorporated into the return estimate. In addition, we include a per- token KL penalty term from the learned policy  $\pi_{\theta}$  to the initial policy  $\pi_{\mathrm{soft}}$  obtained through imitation learning at each token to mitigate overoptimization. This term is scaled by the coefficient  $\beta$

Then the advantage function can be approximated by

$$
\begin{array}{rlr}{\hat{A} (s_t,a_t)} & = & {\hat{R}_t - \hat{V}_\phi (s_t).} \end{array} \tag{4}
$$

Finally, the policy and value objectives can be given by

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{policy}}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{\tau '\sim \pi_\theta^{\mathrm{old}}}\bigg[\min \bigg(\frac{\pi_\theta(a_t|s_t)}{\pi_\theta^{\mathrm{old}}(a_t|s_t)}\hat{A} (s_t,a_t), \tag{5}
$$

$$
\mathrm{clip}\Big(\frac{\pi_{\theta}(a_t|s_t)}{\pi_\theta^{\mathrm{old}}(a_t|s_t)},1 - \epsilon ,1 + \epsilon \Big)\hat{A} (s_t,a_t)\Big)\bigg]
$$

and

$$
\begin{array}{rl}\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{value}}(\phi) = & \mathbb{E}_{\tau '\sim \pi_\theta^{\mathrm{old}}}\bigg[\max \bigg((\hat{\mathrm{R}}_t - \hat{V}_\phi (s_t))^2,\\ & \big(\hat{R}_t - \hat{V}_\phi^{\mathrm{clip}}(s_t)\big)^2\bigg)\bigg], \end{array} \tag{6}
$$

respectively, where

$$
\begin{array}{rl}\hat{V}_{\phi}^{\mathrm{clip}}(s_t) = & \mathrm{clip}\Big(\hat{V}_\phi (s_t),V_\phi^{\mathrm{old}}(s_t) - \epsilon ,V_\phi^{\mathrm{old}}(s_t) + \epsilon \Big). \end{array} \tag{7}
$$

Here,  $\pi_{\theta}^{\mathrm{old}}$  and  $V_{\phi}^{\mathrm{old}}$  is used for sampling and  $\tau^{\prime}$  is session trajectory. We then combine these into the unified RL loss:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{RL}}(\theta ,\phi) = \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{policy}}(\theta) + \eta \cdot \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{value}}(\phi) \tag{8}
$$

where  $\eta$  is the coefficient of the value objective.

# 4.3 Selector

The Selector is an LLM agent that takes two inputs: a scholar query and a research paper (including its title and abstract). It generates two outputs: (1) a single decision token  $d$  either "True" or "False", indicating whether the paper satisfies the query, and (2) a rationale  $r = (r_1,r_2,\ldots ,r_m)$  containing  $m$  tokens that support this decision. The rationale serves two purposes: enhancing decision accuracy by jointly training the model to generate decisions and explanations, and improving user trust by providing the reasoning in PaSa application.

To optimize training efficiency for the Crawler, the decision token is presented before the rationale, allowing the Selector to act as a single- token reward model during the Crawler training. Additionally, the token probability of the decision token can be used to rank search results. At last, as shown in Table 6, the order of the decision and rationale does not affect the Selector's performance.

We perform imitation learning to optimize the Selector. See Appendix E for training data collection and training details.

# 5 Experiments

# 5.1 Experimental Setting

We sequentially trained the Selector and Crawler, both based on the Qwen2.5- th (Yang et al., 2024), to develop the final agent, referred to as PaSa- 7b.

Selector The Selector was fine- tuned using the training dataset described in Appendix E. We conducted supervised fine- tuning for one epoch with a learning rate of 1e- 5 and a batch size of 4. The training runs on 8 NVIDIA- H100 GPUs.

Crawler The training process involves two stages. First, we perform imitation learning for 1 epoch on 12,989 training data with a learning rate of 1e- 5 and batch size of 4 per device, using 8 NVIDIA H100 GPUs. In the second stage, we apply PPO training. To ensure stability, we first freeze the policy model and train the value model, followed by co- training both the policy and value models. The hyperparameters used during the training process are listed in Table 12 in Appendix D.2.

During imitation learning, the model encounters 5,000 queries, while during the RL training phase, the model processes a total of 16,000 queries. For more details please refer to Appendix D.1 for the imitation learning data construction and Appendix D.2 for the PPO training data sampling.

Implementation of [Search] The LLM predicts a query based on the context. Then the agent calls Google with the parameters site: arxiv.org and before: query_date, restricting search results by source and publication time.

Paper Management We developed a database to manage and restore research papers. PaSa retrieves paper information from the database. If no matching record is found, we use ar5iv to obtain the full paper content, including citations, and then parse this data and store it in the database.

# 5.2 Baselines and Evaluation

We evaluate our paper search agent on both the test set of AutoScholarQuery and RealScholarQuery. We compare PaSa- 7b against the following baselines:

Google. We use Google to search the query directly, with the same parameter settings in Section 5.1. - Google Scholar. Queries are submitted directly to Google Scholar, with the same parameter settings in Section 5.1. - Google with GPT- 4o. We first employ GPT4o to paraphrase the scholar query. The paraphrased query is then searched on Google. ChatGPT. We submit scholar query to ChatGPT, powered by search- enabled GPT- 4o. GPT- o1. Prompt GPT- o1 to process the scholar query. Note that it does not have access to external search tools. - PaSa- GPT- 4o. Implement PaSa as illustrated in Figure 1 by prompting GPT- 4o. It can perform multiple searches, paper reading, and citation network crawling.

We carefully designed prompts for all baselines and they are shown in Appendix H.2. All baselines, except PaSa- GPT- 4o, represent the best- known scholar search methods. These comparisons highlight the effectiveness of our agentic approach. The comparison with PaSa- GPT- 4o isolates the impact of RL training.

As shown in Figure 2, the crawling process of PaSa can be visualized as a paper tree. In practice, considering the computational expense, we limit the Crawler's exploration depth to three for both PaSa- 7b and PaSa- GPT- 4o.

For Google- based baselines, we evaluate recall using Recall  $a20$  Recall  $a50$  and Recall  $a100$  metrics for the top- 20, top- 50, and top- 100 search results, respectively. For other baselines that do not produce rankings, we assess precision and recall for the final retrieved papers. Additionally, we compare Crawler recall between PaSa- GPT- 4o and PaSa- 7b, defined as the proportion of target papers collected by the Crawler. This measures how many target papers are successfully included in the paper queue generated by the Crawler.

# 5.3 Main results

As shown in Table 4, PaSa- 7b outperforms all baselines on AutoScholarQuery test set. Specifically, compared to the strongest baseline, PaSa- GPT- 4o,

PaSa- 7b demonstrates a  $9.64\%$  improvement in recall with comparable precision. Moreover, the recall of the Crawler in PaSa- 7b is  $3.66\%$  higher than that in PaSa- GPT- 4o. When compared to the best Google- based baseline, Google with GPT- 4o, PaSa- 7b achieves an improvement of  $33.80\%$ $38.83\%$  and  $42.64\%$  in Recall  $a20$  Recall  $a50$  and Recall  $a100$  , respectively.

We observe that using multiple ensembles of Crawler during inference can improve performance. Specifically, we use sampling decoding to run Crawler twice in the PaSa- 7b- ensemble setting, which boosts Crawler recall by  $3.34\%$  on AutoScholarQuery and increases the final recall by  $1.51\%$  , with no significant change in precision.

To evaluate PaSa in a more realistic setting, we assess its effectiveness on RealScholarQuery. As illustrated in Table 5, PaSa- 7b exhibits a greater advantage in real- world academic search scenarios. Compared to PaSa- GPT- 4o, PaSa- 7b achieves improvements of  $30.36\%$  in recall and  $4.25\%$  in precision. Against the best Google- based baseline on RealScholarQuery, Google with GPT- 4o, PaSa- 7b outperforms Google by  $37.78\%$ $39.90\%$  ,and  $39.83\%$  in recall  $a20$  ,recall  $a50$  and recall  $a100$  respectively. Additionally, the PaSa- 7b- ensemble further enhances crawler recall by  $4.32\%$  ,contribut

ing to an overall  $3.52\%$  improvement in the recall of the entire agent system.

As both the final decision- maker and auxiliary reward model in RL training for the Crawler, the performance of the Selector is crucial. To evaluate its effectiveness, we collected a dataset of 200 query- paper pairs, annotating whether each paper meets the query's requirements. This dataset serves as the benchmark for evaluating the Selector (see Appendix F for details). We then compared our Selector against GPT- 4o (Hurst et al., 2024) and Qwen- 2.5- 7b (Yang et al., 2024), as shown in Table 6. The results show that our Selector achieves an F1 score of  $85\%$  , outperforming GPT- 4o by  $5\%$  and Qwen- 2.5- 7b by  $30\%$  . Additionally, when compared to a setting where reasoning precedes decision token generation, the performance is comparable. Lastly, the Selector's precision reaches  $95\%$  , confirming its effectiveness as an auxiliary reward model for the Crawler RL training.

# 5.4 Ablation study

We perform ablation studies in Table 7 to evaluate the individual contributions of exploring citation networks, RL training, and using the Selector as the reward model. The results indicate that removing the [Expand] action from the Crawler leads to a significant drop in the recall: a decrease of  $22.98\%$  on AutoScholarQuery and  $32.21\%$  on RealScholarQuery. Furthermore, RL training enhances recall by  $6.24\%$  on AutoScholarQuery and  $19.96\%$  on RealScholarQuery. The RL training curves are depicted in Figure 3 in Appendix D.2, where the training curves show a steady increase in return with the training steps, eventually converging after 200 steps. Finally, removing the Selector as an auxiliary reward model results in a  $3.76\%$  recall drop on AutoScholarQuery and a  $9.63\%$  drop on RealScholarQuery.

We investigate how to control agent behavior by adjusting the rewards in RL training. Experiments are conducted with varying reward coefficients  $\alpha$  in Equation 1, and results are presented in Table 8. We report two metrics: crawler recall and crawler action. The crawler action refers to the total number of [Search] and [Expand] actions throughout the Crawler's entire trajectory. As the reward increases, both crawler recall and crawler action increase, suggesting that adjusting rewards in RL training can effectively influence PaSa's behavior.

# 6 Conclusion

In this paper, we introduce PaSa, a novel paper search agent designed to provide comprehensive and accurate results for complex academic queries. PaSa is implemented within the AGILE, a reinforcement learning framework for LLM agents. To train PaSa, we developed AutoScholarQuery, a dataset of fine- grained academic queries and corresponding papers drawn from top- tier AI conference publications. To evaluate PaSa in real- world scenarios, we also constructed RealScholarQuery, a dataset of actual academic queries paired with annotated papers. Our experimental results demonstrate that PaSa outperforms all baselines, including Google, Google Scholar, and Google with GPT- 4o, ChatGPT, GPT- o1, and PaSa- GPT- 4o. In particular, PaSa- 7B surpasses Google with GPT- 4o by  $37.78\%$  in recall@20 and  $39.90\%$  in recall@50, while also exceeding PaSa- GPT- 4o by  $30.36\%$  in recall and  $4.25\%$  in precision. These findings underscore that PaSa significantly improves the efficiency and accuracy of academic search.

# Limitations

(1) Our dataset collection and experiments were primarily focused on the field of machine learning. Although our proposed method is general, we did not explore its performance in other scientific fields. We leave to investigate its applicability to other domains in future work.

(2) Due to resource constraints, our experiments primarily use LLMs with 7b parameters. We expect that scaling up to larger models will lead to more powerful agents. Expanding PaSa to leverage larger LLMs is our future work.

# A Quality Evaluation of AutoScholarQuery

To assess the quality of AutoScholarQuery, we sampled 100 query- paper pairs and evaluated the rationality and relevance of each query and its corresponding paper. The detailed evaluation criteria are as follows:

- A qualified query should be a complete and understandable sentence. For example, incomplete or fragmented sentences are not acceptable.- A query that misrepresents the meaning of the source paper, leading to irrelevant citations, is not qualified. This includes queries that

exaggerate the scope or introduce incorrect conditions.

- A query is ambiguous if there is insufficient context and additional information is needed. For instance, abbreviations with multiple meanings can create ambiguity, leading to the corresponding citations being incomplete answer lists.

- An answer paper is considered qualified if it aligns with the requirements of the query. The paper should address all or most of the essential factors that make it a suitable response.

Our quality check found that  $94.0\%$  of the queries were qualified. Among them,  $93.7\%$  of the corresponding answer papers were also qualified. The primary reason for unqualified papers was inaccurate citations in the source paper.

# B Annotation details

The annotators of RealScholarQuery include professors from the Department of Computer Science at a top- tier university in China. They are paid $4 per data entry, which consists of a user query and a research paper. Their task is to determine whether the paper satisfies the query.

# The prompt for search query generation

You are an elite researcher in the field of AI, please generate some mutually exclusive queries in a list to search the relevant papers according to the User Query. Searching for a survey paper would be better. User Query: {user_query} The semantics between generated queries are not mutually inclusive. The format of the list is: ["query1", "query2", ...] Queries:

# B.1 Annotation Instructions

For each <user query, paper> pair, carefully assess whether the paper address the user query. Write your decision and provide a brief explanation (1- 2 sentences). Specific guidelines are as follows:

You may read the entire paper to determine whether it satisfies the user query. Exclude survey papers unless the user query specifically requests them. All conditions in the user query must be met for the paper to be considered qualified.

# B.2 Quality control

The annotation process follows the following quality control measures:

Stage 1: Annotators work in batches of 20. Authors review  $100\%$  of the annotations. Once the consistency rate on the first pass reaches  $90\%$  , the process moves to Stage 2. Stage 2: Annotators work in batches of 50. Authors randomly check  $40\%$  of the annotations. If the consistency rate is below  $90\%$  ,the entire batch is re- annotated and re- checked. Once the batch meets the  $90\%$  consistency rate on the first pass, the process moves to Stage 3.

Stage 3: Annotators work in batches of 100. Authors randomly check  $20\%$  of the annotations. If the consistency rate is below  $90\%$  ,the entire batch is re- annotated and re- checked.

Two authors conducted the quality control.

# D.1 Imitation learning data generation

We generate training data for imitation learning on a session- by- session basis. There are two types of sessions: search session (starting from state  $S_{q}$  and expand session (starting from state  $S_{q + p}$  -

For search sessions starting from  $S_{q}$  , we sample user queries from the AutoScholarQuery training set and prompt GPT- 4o to generate corresponding search queries. The prompt template is shown in Table 10. The session trajectory is constructed by adding a [Search] token before each query, concatenating the queries, and appending a [Stop] token at the end, as shown in Table 11. A total of 3,011 search session trajectories are generated.

For expanded sessions starting from  $S_{q + p}$  , we continue by searching for the generated queries using Google. We then sample papers from the search results and obtain the initial state, which includes

both the query and a paper. To build the session trajectory, we examine each sub- section of the paper. If the sub- section references at least one paper in the AutoScholarQuery training set corresponding to the query, the sub- section is selected. Otherwise, the sub- section is selected with a  $10\%$  probability to enhance trajectory diversity. The selected sections are filled into the template in Table 11, completing the session trajectory. In total, 9,978 expanded session trajectories are constructed.

# D.2 PPO training

During PPO training, each device processes 4 user queries in each step, generating a search session for each user query. Then, 6 expansion sessions are created by randomly sampling 6 papers from the search results. This process is repeated with the expanded citation results, yielding 6 additional expanded sessions. In total, 16 session trajectories are generated per step.

Table 12 lists the hyperparameters used during the training process. Figure 3 depicts the RL training curves, which show a steady increase in return with the training steps, eventually converging after 200 steps.

# E Implementation Details of the Selector

We begin by sampling user queries from the AutoScholarQuery training set. For each user query and one of its corresponding papers in the AutoScholarQuery training set, we prompt GPT- 4o to generate a decision token and rationale (see Table 13 for the prompt). We reject any data where the decision token is "False", as this contradicts the AutoScholarQuery label. The remaining data are retained as positive <user query, paper> pairs.

Figure 3: Return and value function loss curves during the PPO training process. The smoothing method of the curve in the figures is the exponential moving average(EMA) formula that aligns with the one used in TensorBoard, and the smoothing weight is set to 0.95.

Next, we simulate a partial paper search using PaSa- GPT- 4o. In this simulation, each paper has a  $50\%$  probability of being added to the paper queue. Pairs where the paper is not selected by GPT- 4o and is not in the AutoScholarQuery training set are labeled as negative examples.

The final training dataset consists of 19,812 <user query, paper> pairs, each with a decision token and rationale generated by GPT- 4o, drawn from 9,000 instances in the AutoScholarQuery training set.

# F Selector Test Dataset

We select 200 queries from the AutoScholarQuery development set. For each query, we perform a Google search and randomly choose one paper from the union of the search results and the relevant paper set in AutoScholarQuery. This yields a set of <user query, paper> pairs. Annotators then evaluate whether each paper aligns with the requirements of the user query. The final test dataset consists of 98 positive samples and 102 negative samples.

# G Additional Experimental Results

# G.1 Results on 100-sample subset of AutoScholarQuery

To ensure a fair comparison with the ChatGPT baseline, which is evaluated on only 100 samples from AutoScholarQuery test, we report the performance of all methods on the same subset in Table 14. The results align with those in Table 4, confirming that PaSa- 7b consistently outperforms all baselines.

# G.2 Action cost

We incorporate action costs to prevent the agent from taking excessive, unproductive actions. Without such costs, the total number of actions would increase significantly without yielding meaningful outcomes.

The key consideration is the reward coefficient  $\alpha$  and the action cost  $c(a_{t})$  in Equation 1. In Table 8, we fix  $c(a_{t})$  and analyze how varying  $\alpha$  affects performance.

Additionally, Table 15 shows how different values of  $c(a_{t})$  affect the final performance.

# H Prompt Templates

# H.1 Prompts used for data synthesis in AutoScholarQuery

Table 16 presents the prompt template used with GPT- 4o to automatically generate AutoScholarQuery. For each paper, we extract its Related Work section, input it into GPT- 4o, and use the prompt to generate scholarly queries along with their corresponding paper answers.
